1.ConcurrentHashMap is the class that is similar to HashMap but works fine when you try to modify your map 
at runtime.

Question - How does iterator know that there has been some modification in the HashMap?
Answer - 
1.We have taken the set of keys from HashMap once and then iterating over it.
2.HashMap contains a variable to count the number of modifications and iterator use it 
when you call its next() function to get the next entry.


/**
     * The number of times this HashMap has been structurally modified
     * Structural modifications are those that change the number of mappings in
     * the HashMap or otherwise modify its internal structure (e.g.,
     * rehash).  This field is used to make iterators on Collection-views of
     * the HashMap fail-fast.  (See ConcurrentModificationException).

    transient volatile int modCount;
