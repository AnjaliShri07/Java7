*****Now let’s take a look at code: CODE_EXPLANATION*********
Create class CrunchifyConcurrentHashMapVsSynchronizedHashMap.java
Create object for each HashTable, SynchronizedMap and CrunchifyConcurrentHashMap
Add and retrieve 500k entries from Map
Measure start and end time and display time in milliseconds
We will use ExecutorService to run 5 threads in parallel.

shutdown() means the executor service takes no more incoming tasks.
awaitTermination() is invoked after a shutdown request.

And hence, you need to first shutdown the serviceExecutor and then block and wait for threads to finish.
